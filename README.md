**Overview**
This project contains a C# script (RobotController.cs) for controlling an autonomous robot in Unity using WheelColliders. The script handles steering, speed control, obstacle avoidance, and path following.

**Features**
Wheel Control: Uses WheelCollider for realistic physics-based movement. Obstacle Avoidance: Uses Raycasting to detect and avoid obstacles dynamically. Autonomous Navigation: Adjusts speed and steering angles based on sensor inputs. PID-Based Motion Control: Ensures smooth turning and accurate navigation.

**Tech Stack**
Language: C#
Engine: Unity3D
Physics: WheelColliders, Rigidbody
Sensors: Raycasting for road detection & obstacle avoidance
